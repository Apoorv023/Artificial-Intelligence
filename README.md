# Artificial-Intelligence
This repository contains the project made by me under the Artificial Intelligence course.
The file 'code.py' contains the code for implementing Viterbi algorithm for part of speech(PoS) tagging using the training data present in the file 'train.txt'.
The training data and the test data for the project has been taken from the site: "https://www.clips.uantwerpen.be/conll2000/chunking/".
The file 'training.py' tests the algorithm implemented in the file 'code.py' on the test data present in the file 'test.txt'.
