# Artificial-Intelligence
This repository contains the project made by me under the Artificial Intelligence course.
The file 'code.py' contains the code for implementing Viterbi algorithm for part of speech(PoS) tagging using the training data present in the file 'train.txt'.
The training data and the test data for the project has been taken from the site: "https://www.clips.uantwerpen.be/conll2000/chunking/".
The file 'training.py' tests the algorithm implemented in the file 'code.py' on the test data present in the file 'test.txt'.
There are 2 CSV files attached that were saved at the time of executing the code.
The CSV file 'Dataset.csv' contains the training data and has three colums: first contains the word, second contains its PoS tag, and the third one contains the count regarding how many times the (word, tag) pair has occurred in the training data.
The CSV file 'Tags_bigram_matrix' contains the bigram matrix of PoS tags.
A png file 'cmd output.png' shows the code's command prompt output for some of the inputs given during the code execution.
